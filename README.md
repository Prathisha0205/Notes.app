# Notes.app
The MERN Notes App is a full-stack web application that allows users to create, read, update, and delete (CRUD) personal notes. It is built using the MERN stack, which includes MongoDB, Express.js, React.js, and Node.js. Users can optionally assign color labels or categories to organize their notes more efficiently.
